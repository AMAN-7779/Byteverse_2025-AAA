# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.




<AI-Powered Traffic Forecasting & Accident Alert System>
<Overview>
Urban cities today face two major transportation challenges:

Unexpected Traffic Jams: Costing time, fuel, and patience.

Delayed Accident Response: Leading to preventable fatalities and longer emergency response times.

Our project offers an AI-driven solution that monitors real-time traffic, predicts future congestion, and detects accidents instantly to ensure rapid emergency response.

üß© <Core Components>
üì° Real-Time Traffic Monitoring
Continuously gathers live traffic flow data from trusted sources like Google Maps API.

Displays current road congestion levels to commuters and authorities.

Helps in better decision-making for daily travel and road management.

üìà <Future Traffic Forecasting>
Trains models using 4+ years of historical traffic data.

Predicts traffic volume for upcoming hours or days.

Supports urban planning, peak time prediction, and smarter route suggestions.

üö® <Accident Detection & Emergency Alerting>
<p>Uses CCTV or video streams to monitor vehicle movement and behavior.

Detects sudden halts, collisions, or abnormal driving patterns indicating accidents.

Instantly triggers alerts:

Sends notifications to traffic control authorities.

Alerts nearby hospitals to dispatch emergency services.

Optionally captures and stores incident snapshots for records.<p>

üéØ <Use Case Scenarios>
For Daily Commuters
Check real-time traffic status and plan safer, faster routes.

For Urban Planners & Traffic Authorities
Predict peak congestion times, improve traffic management systems, and monitor accident hotspots.

For Emergency Services
Receive instant accident notifications to reduce response time and save lives.
